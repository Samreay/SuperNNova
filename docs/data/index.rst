Data walkthrough
=========================

Recommended code organization structure:

.. code::

    ├── snndump        (to save the data)
    │
    ├── SuperNNova
    │   ├── supernnova
    │   ├── env
    │   ├── docs
    │   ├── tests


**To build the database:**

- Ensure you have raw data saved to ``{raw_dir}/raw``
- The default settings assume the raw data and fits are saved to ``snndump/raw``
- You can save the data in any folder, but you then have to specify the ``dump_dir`` with the ``--dump_dir XXX`` command.
- You can specify a different place where the raw data is using ``--raw_dir XXX`` command.
- You can specify a different place where the fits to data is using ``--fits_dir XXX`` command.


Activate the environment
-------------------------------

**Either use docker**

.. code::

    cd env && python launch_docker.py (--use_cuda optional)

**Or activate your conda environment**

.. code::

    source activate <conda_env_name>


Creating a debugging database
-------------------------------

.. code::

    python run.py --data --dump_dir tests/dump --raw_dir tests/raw --fits_dir tests/fits

- This creates a database for a very small subset of all available data
- This is intended for debugging purposes (training, validation can run very fast with this small database)
- The database is saved to the specified ``tests/dump/processed``


Creating a training database
------------------------------

.. code::

    python run.py --data --dump_dir <path/to/full/database/>

- You **DO NEED** to download the raw data for this database
- This creates a database for all of the available data
- The database is saved to the specified ``dump_dir``, in the ``processed`` subfolder


Under the hood
-------------------------------

Preparing data splits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We first compute the data splits:

- By default the HEAD FITS files are analyzed to compute 80/10/10 train/test/val splits.
- You can change if the databse contains 99.5/0.5/0.5 train/test/val splits using ``--data_training`` command. 
- You can change if the databse contains 0.5/0.5/99.5 train/test/val splits using ``--data_testing`` command.
- The splits are different for the salt/photometry datasets
- The splits are different depending on the classification target
- We downsample the dataset so that for a given classification task, all classes have the same cardinality

Preprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We then pre-process each FITS file

- Join column from header files
- Select columns that will be useful later on
- Compute SNID to tag each light curve
- Compute delta times between measures
- Removal of delimiter rows


Pivot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We then pivot each FITS file: we will group time-wise close observations on the same row
and each row in the dataframe will show a value for each of the flux and flux error column

- All observations within 8 hours of each other are assigned the same MJD
- Results are cached with pickle for faster loading


HDF5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The processed database is saved to ``dump_dir/processed`` in HDF5 format for convenient use
in the ML pipeline

The HDF5 file is organized as follows:

.. code::

    ├── data                            (variable length array to store time series)
    │
    │

    ├── dataset_photometry_3classes     (0: train set, 1: valid set, 2: test set, -1: not used)
    ├── dataset_photometry_7classes     (0: train set, 1: valid set, 2: test set, -1: not used)

    │   ...
    │
    ├── SNID                            The ID of the lightcurve
    ├── PEAKMJD                         The MJD value at which a lightcurve reaches peak light
    ├── SNTYPE                          The type of the lightcurve (120, 121...)
    │
    ...                                 (Other metadata / features about lightcurves)
